# Exploring P5 and drawing constellations in the sky :D
*February 27th, 2024.*

Last weekend, I attended a personal computing hackathon in NYC! It was a cozy event that gave me the perfect excuse to finally try p5.js.

The end result looks like this. Fair warning, I made it in a few hours so it is a bit jank :P

## How p5.js Works

At its core, p5.js makes creative coding really approachable through two main functions:

1. **`setup()`** - Runs once at the start of your program. It is used to set up the canvas, initialize variables, and prepare your environment.

2. **`draw()`** - Runs continuously after `setup()` completes, refreshing the canvas many times per second to create animations or interactive experiences.

In our project, the `setup()` function is used to create the initial set of stars randomly across the canvas. The `draw()` function is used to update the screen as the user connects dots.

# Step-by-step breakdown to create Constellations

First, let's create a basic p5.js sketch:

```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(windowWidth, 200);
}

function draw() {
    background("#abcdef"); // a faint blue :D
}
```

  src="/blog/special/constellations/step0.html"
  width="100%"
  height="110px"
  style="overflow: hidden;"
  sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>
Uhh wait, did that just work? Even if it seems like we referenced a variable that doesn't exist, p5 comes with `windowWidth`, which under the hood pulls data from the browser's window dimensions (`window.innerWidth`). Whenever the browser is resized, this value is also updated.

## A star is born
Now, let's draw a single star. There are a few things:
1. A star should be randomly placed, but always on the canvas.
2. In between rerenders, the star should not change placement (unless you refresh the page).
3. A star should shimmer (this is a bit hard, but we can mimick shine by making the star pulse in size with the `sin()` function).

```javascript
let PADDING = 16; // Padding to keep stars from generating on the edge of the canvas
let time = 0;
let starX = 0;
let starY = 0;
let radius = 10;

function setup() {
    starX = Math.random() * (windowWidth - PADDING * 2) + PADDING;
    starY = Math.random() * (windowHeight - PADDING * 2) + PADDING;
    createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

function draw() {
    time += 1;
    let addedRadius = 5 * Math.sin(time / 10);
    background("#05061c");
    fill("#ffe45e"); // yellow
    ellipse(starX, starY, radius + addedRadius, radius + addedRadius);
}
``` 

On top of this code, I also added a few more circles of layered opacity to make the star look a bit more shiny.

```javascript
function drawStar(x, y, r) {
    let addedRadius = 5 * Math.sin(time / 10);
    let shimmer = random(-0.5, 0.5);
    noStroke();
    for (let i = 4; i >= 0; i--) {
    let alpha = map(i, 0, 4, 10, 50);
    fill(255, 228, 94, alpha);
    let glowRadius = (r + addedRadius) * (2.5 - i * 0.4) + shimmer;
    }
    fill(255, 228, 94); // solid yellow
    ellipse(x, y, r + addedRadius + shimmer, r + addedRadius + shimmer);
}
```

```javascript
function draw() {
    time += 1;
    background("#05061c"); // sky
    drawStar(starX, starY, radius);
}
```

## More stars of varying sizes

Now, let's add a few more stars to the canvas. At this point it makes sense to store each star as an object with a paint function. This is because later on, we will join the stars together to form constellations.

```javascript
let PADDING = 16;
let time = 0;
let stars = [];

class Star {
    x;
    y;

    constructor() {
        this.x = Math.random() * (windowWidth - PADDING * 2) + PADDING;
        this.y = Math.random() * (windowHeight - PADDING * 2) + PADDING;
        this.radius = Math.random() * 5;
    }

    draw(c, time) {
    let addedRadius = 5 * Math.sin(time / 10);

    let shimmer = random(-0.5, 0.5);
    noStroke();
    for (let i = 4; i >= 0; i--) {
        let alpha = map(i, 0, 4, 10, 50);
        fill(255, 228, 94, alpha);
        let glowRadius = (this.radius + addedRadius) * (2.5 - i * 0.4) + shimmer;
        ellipse(this.x, this.y, glowRadius, glowRadius);
    }
    fill(255, 228, 94); // solid yellow
    ellipse(this.x, this.y, this.radius + addedRadius + shimmer, this.radius + addedRadius + shimmer);
    }
}

function setup() {
    stars = Array.from({ length: 10 }, () => new Star());
    createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

function draw() {
    time += 1;
    background("#05061c");
    stars.forEach(star => star.draw(this, time));
}
```

## Connect the dots
These stars look super nice, but I want to be able to connect them to form shapes. This requires introducing lines that connect them.

A line can be defined by the two points (or stars) that it connects:

```javascript
class Line {
  star1;
  star2;

  constructor(star1, star2) {
    this.star1 = star1;
    this.star2 = star2;
  }

  draw() {
    strokeWeight(4);
    stroke("#ffe45e");
    line(this.star1.x, this.star1.y, this.star2.x, this.star2.y);
    strokeWeight(1); // reset stroke weight
  }
}
```

But how do you know what is star1 and star2 based off of mouse clicks, drags, and other movements?

There are conceptually a few tricky parts to adding user interactions to this project.

### When a user clicks on the screen, detect closest star
A user will almost never click on the exact x and y of a star. As a result, we need to detect which star is closest to the click. 

This can be done by calculating the distance between the click and each star and selecting the star with the smallest distance. 

There also needs to be some distance threshold so that a user click on something that is obviously not a star, nothing is selected.

### Different line modes
There are two types of lines:
1. Normal lines: These are lines that are part of the drawn constellation.
2. Preview lines: A user already selected a start star and is draggint their mouse to figure out where to draw the next star. There should be some nice snapping behavior so that the line is always going in the right direction.
3. Invalid lines: A user is dragging a line from a star to a non-star. This should not be allowed.

```javascript
class Line {
    constructor(star1, star2, type = "normal") {
    this.star1 = star1;
    this.star2 = star2;
    this.type = type;
    }

    getColor() {
    switch (this.type) {
        case "normal": return "#fffb94";
        case "placeholder": return "#fffb94";
        case "invalid": return "#EFC3E6";
    }
    }

    draw() {
    // Convert hex colors to RGB for proper alpha handling
    let c = color(this.getColor());
    
    // add glow effect
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        let alpha = map(i, 0, 4, 10, 50);
        stroke(red(c), green(c), blue(c), alpha);
        strokeWeight(i);
        line(this.star1.x, this.star1.y, this.star2.x, this.star2.y);
    }
    
    // Draw main line
    stroke(this.getColor());
    strokeWeight(1);
    line(this.star1.x, this.star1.y, this.star2.x, this.star2.y);
    }
}
```

Moreover, this is the first time we are adding user interactions. I decided to make this owned by a Constellations class, but this is just for organization purposes and is lowkey optional.

```javascript
class Constellations {
    constructor(width, height) {
    this.recalculate(width, height);
    }

    recalculate(width, height) {
    this.width = width - 100;
    this.height = height - 150;
    this.distanceThreshold = Constellations._calc_distance_threshold();
    this.dotRadius = Constellations._calc_dot_radius();
    }

    // "Private" helper methods
    static _break_points = [425, 768, 1024];
    static _calc_dot_radius() {
    if (windowWidth < Constellations._break_points[0]) {
        return 20;
    }
    if (windowWidth < Constellations._break_points[1]) {
        return 16;
    }
    if (windowWidth < Constellations._break_points[2]) {
        return 14;
    }
    return 10;
    }
    static _calc_distance_threshold() {
    return this._calc_dot_radius() * 2;
    }

    getDistanceThreshold() {
    return this.distanceThreshold;
    }
    getDotRadius() {
    return this.dotRadius;
    }

    getWidth() {
    return this.width;
    }

    getHeight() {
    return this.height;
    }  
}
function mousePressed() {
    for (let star of stars) {
    let d = dist(mouseX, mouseY, star.x, star.y);
    if (d < 20) {
        if (lastClickedStar) {
        constellationLines.push(new Line(lastClickedStar, star));
        }
        star.toggle();
        lastClickedStar = star;
        break;
    }
    }
}

function mouseDragged() {
    if (!lastClickedStar) return;
    
    let mousePos = new Star();
    mousePos.x = mouseX;
    mousePos.y = mouseY;
    
    let nearStar = stars.find(star => dist(mouseX, mouseY, star.x, star.y) < 20);
    placeholderLine = new Line(
    lastClickedStar,
    nearStar || mousePos,
    nearStar ? "placeholder" : "invalid"
    );
}

function mouseReleased() {
    if (!placeholderLine) return;
    
    if (placeholderLine.type === "placeholder") {
    constellationLines.push(placeholderLine);
    placeholderLine.star2.toggle();
    lastClickedStar = placeholderLine.star2;
    }
    placeholderLine = null;
}
```

## Overkill: Adding a bunch of extra features
Normally, this is where people end the blog post and say, "have fun!". But since we're already here, we might as well do some more.

### Adding noise
Right now, our stars are randomized in sizing and placement, but they all pulse in unison. We want to add noise to the stars so that they each pulse at different rates.

### Nonlinear, pulsing lines

Creating straight lines between stars is visually pleasing, but adding some natural, fluid motion can elevate the aesthetic to the next level. This is where nonlinear, pulsing lines come into play. By incorporating Perlin noise through p5.js's built-in `noise()` function, we can generate smooth, organic variations that make our constellations feel more dynamic and alive.

#### Understanding Perlin Noise
**Perlin Noise** is a type of gradient noise developed by Ken Perlin. Unlike random noise, Perlin noise is smooth and continuous, making it ideal for generating natural phenomena like fire, clouds, and, in our case, wavy lines. Its continuity ensures that the variations are smooth rather than abrupt, resulting in more aesthetically pleasing animations.

in our case, we divide our line into a few segments and apply noise to the y-coordinates of the points, in order to draw a wavy line that still connects the two endpoints.

```javascript
class Line {
  constructor(star1, star2, type = "normal") {
    this.star1 = star1;
    this.star2 = star2;
    this.type = type;
    
    this.waveSegments = 10;
    this.amplitude = 10;
    this.xScale = 0.05;   
    this.tScale = 0.01;
    this.speed = 0.05;
    this.hueSpeed = 0.5;  // Speed of hue change
  }

  // ... (other methods)
}
```

```javascript
getWavyPoints() {
    let points = [];
    let dx = this.star2.x - this.star1.x;
    let dy = this.star2.y - this.star1.y;
    let dist = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    let nx = -dy / dist;
    let ny =  dx / dist;
    
    let controlPoints = [];
    for (let i = 0; i <= this.waveSegments; i++) {
        let t = i / this.waveSegments;
        let x = this.star1.x + t * dx;
        let y = this.star1.y + t * dy;
        if (i !== 0 && i !== this.waveSegments) {
            let n = noise(i * this.xScale, frameCount * this.speed * this.tScale, time / 200);
            let offset = map(n, 0, 1, -this.amplitude, this.amplitude);
            x += nx * offset;
            y += ny * offset;
        }
        controlPoints.push({ x, y });
    }

    // ... (Catmull-Rom spline interpolation)
}
```

After generating the wavy control points, we apply Catmull-Rom splines—an interpolation method that takes four points and a parameter t (ranging from 0 to 1) to calculate intermediate points—resulting in a smooth curve through the control points.

```javascript
catmullRom(p0, p1, p2, p3, t) {
    return 0.5 * (
        (2 * p1) +
        (-p0 + p2) * t +
        (2 * p0 - 5 * p1 + 4 * p2 - p3) * t * t +
        (-p0 + 3 * p1 - 3 * p2 + p3) * t * t * t
    );
}

draw() {
  let wavyPoints = this.getWavyPoints();
  
  push();
  colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100, 100);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    let c = this.getColor(i * 15);
    strokeWeight(i);
    stroke(hue(c), saturation(c), brightness(c), 5);

    for (let j = 0; j < wavyPoints.length - 1; j++) {
      let p1 = wavyPoints[j];
      let p2 = wavyPoints[j + 1];
      line(p1.x, p1.y, p2.x, p2.y);
    }
  }

  let c = this.getColor();
  let alpha = noise(frameCount * 0.01) * 50;
  stroke(hue(c), saturation(c), brightness(c), alpha);
  strokeWeight(1);
  for (let j = 0; j < wavyPoints.length - 1; j++) {
    let p1 = wavyPoints[j];
    let p2 = wavyPoints[j + 1];
    line(p1.x, p1.y, p2.x, p2.y);
  }
  
  pop();
}
```

## Try it yourself!

If you're interested in creative coding or generative art, I highly recommend giving p5.js a try. 

This tutorial is a pretty simple version of this. For a more advanced version, you can check out the [full source code on GitHub](https://github.com/joyliu-q/constellations), where I also implemented deleting lines, undo, randomized seeds to draw with your friends, and more!

Have fun drawing constellations! :D
